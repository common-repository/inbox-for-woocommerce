== Installation ==
Setup and Configuration

On the first installation of the extension, shop owners would need to complete the installation wizard

To start the installation wizard, go to WooCommerce > Settings > Inbox Tab

Once the installation wizard is started:

Step 1: Sign in Or Sign up to Inbox for WooCommerce.

New users would be required to create an account to start using the inbox for the WooCommerce extension. Registration is free and simple, with most fields already prefilled with information from the WordPress platform. If the user already has an account, the user should complete the sign-in process instead.

Step 2: Select where to manage tickets/messages

The shop owner would need to select where to manage tickets/messages. The default location for handling is the WordPress admin dashboard. However, users can choose to manage from helpdesks like Zendesk or Freshdesk.

Please Note: If a helpdesk is selected, the store owners would need to validate their helpdesk accounts to link it with the store

Step 3: Personalize your settings. The final step would be to personalize your store\'s \"Inbox for WooCommerce\" settings, by selecting which features would be running on your store.

Once the setup wizard is completed, your Inbox for WooCommerce is ready to go!

By default, the extension is enabled on installation completion.
